# How to Keep a Very Long ONNELLAB Workflow Article Title Readable on Mobile and Desktop

## Question

How should this template organize a long article?

## Short Answer

This section should feed the summary box and should not appear again in the body.

## Recommended Workflow

- Start with the reader problem.
- Show the lowest-risk workflow.
- Link to the matching [ONNELLAB application](/apps/vaultxt/).

> Keep the callout short enough to scan before the reader reaches the detailed workflow.

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | Answers the core question quickly |
| Related apps | Connects the workflow to a concrete ONNELLAB utility |

topics.csv -> markdown draft -> image_spec.json -> published page

## FAQ

### Should FAQ answers be rendered as normal paragraphs?

No. FAQ questions should become collapsible details so long articles stay easy to scan.

### Can related recommendations include URLs?

Yes. The template should render recommendation metadata as links when a URL is provided.
